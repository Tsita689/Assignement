# Assignement
2 bit binary adder.
OVERVIEW:
Designing, simulating, testing and documenting a 2 bit binary circuit using basic gates, that can add 2 binary numbers and produce a 3 bit output including a carry bit.
Circuit A consists of two half adders and one OR gate to handle the carry bit
Circuit B consists of three half adders and one OR gate to also handle the carry bit
